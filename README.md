To get proper EMG signals suitable for detecting hand gestures, we had to check which feature is appropriate for generating the model.

We used 2-channel sensor to get hand EMG signal ( , ) and took gestures to get signals.

Each signals are recorded 100 times per second as .csv files.

We used Pytorch to get deep learning models. Each models are saved in folders, orderby its create date.
