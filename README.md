# Application for Human Interface Device using EMG Signal

This study focuses on the development of user-customized input device using EMG signals, and for this purpose, the following research areas are included. In the field of biometric signal measurement, EMG sensors are used to accurately measure finger and hand movements, and accurate data is secured through noise removal and signal correction.

Data signal analysis through deep learning develops a model that can recognize patterns by learning collected EMG data and classify various actions. Using the feature values extracted from the measured signals, a CNN (Convolutionary Neural Network)-based model is constructed and the system is designed to enable real-time motion prediction. In addition, through interface technology research, data is executed in a Bluetooth wireless communication method. It improves the interaction between the user and the device by transmitting time.

In the application development area, an environment in which EMG signals can be used as an input method is established, and an interface is designed so that users can intuitively input actions. It visually feeds back real-time signal analysis results and provides customized functions for various application scenarios.

 Additionally, this study takes into account ergonomic design to improve the user experience and explores the possibility of expansion as a universal input technology that can be used in the elderly, the disabled, and special situations.
